    "text": "Money can feel crazy.\n\nStep back from the edge.\n\nBeing worried about money is scary. It can have far-reaching and detrimental effects on your mental and physical health, your relationships, and overall well-being.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nWhen it comes to how you behave with money, permanent change is possible and working with a Ramsey-certified Financial Coach can help get you there!\n\n\n\n\nCultivate contentment.\n\nThere’s a better place for you.\n\nContentment is a powerful mindset! None of us are entitled to anything in this life and if we actually got a glimpse of what we really deserved we would have a greater appreciation for the things we do have. Learning to be content is challenging but definitely possible and well worth the adjustment to your thinking. It can positively impact your mood and your behavior and coincidentally, your relationships and your wallet.\nLet’s work together to build a mentality where you are at peace with yourself and the world around you. You’ll be surprised at the impact it will have on your ability to build wealth!\n\n\nIf you think you’re alone, you’re not.\n\nI’m here to meet you where you are. Together, we can figure out what to do. I’ll be alongside you every step of the way! Hiring a financial coach can change your life and your family tree."
