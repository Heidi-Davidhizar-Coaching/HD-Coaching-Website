# Money can feel crazy.

### Step back from the edge.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
Being worried about money is scary.  It can have far-reaching and detrimental effects on your mental and physical health and overall well-being. 

Financial stress can create tension and conflict in relationships and strain family dynamics to a tipping point. Additionally, the constant worry about money can prevent you from focusing on other aspects of your life, negatively impacting work and personal performance. In the long run, this stress can also increase poor financial decision-making, making it even more difficult to alleviate financial concerns. 

But it doesn't have to be this way.  When it comes to how you behave with money, permanent change is possible. 

It starts with a change in your mindset.

Being content is a feeling of peace and satisfaction. It is a state where you feel happy with what you have and do not feel the need to strive for more. You can have contentment with life, with your relationships, with work, and with yourself. 

Working toward a place of contentment will help you achieve a sense of balance and fulfillment, and you will start to appreciate the simple pleasures in life. You'll start to let go of stress and worries and focus on the positive. This new outlook can become your 'new normal' and you'll find it easier to embrace change and uncertainty with a sense of calm and ease. 

Let's work together to build a mentality where you are at peace with yourself and the world around you.  You'll be surprised at the impact it will have on your ability to build wealth!
